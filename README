The main idea it's create a command line application that generate code and html files similar as how ruby on rails works.
Now only support the razor view engine in Nancy
This is a work in progress you can try with this commands:

*In the command line, located in the project folder*

appgen struct 
Generate all the folder structure for a Nancy web application (Views,Controllers, shared folders), now the assets with js,img and css are missing,need to add.


appgen generate controller {controllerName} {action1} {action2} {action3}

Generate a controller with the name {controllerName} and with the actions named {action1},{action2},{action3}, also generate the cshtml views.
Example:
appgen generate Greetings hello bye

appgen generate model {ModelName} {fieldName:type} {fieldName:type} {fieldName:type}
Generate a model class with the name {ModelName} and the field defined with {fieldName:type}
Example:
appgen generate model Person Id:integer Name:string BirthDate:datetime status:bool

appgen generate scaffold {ModelName} {fieldName:type} {fieldName:type}
Generate a model class with the name {ModelName} and the field defined with {fieldName:type} and generate a controller with the actions and view to do all the CRUD for the model (Index,New,Edit,Delete)
Example:
appgen generate scaffold Person Id:integer Name:string BirthDate:datetime status:bool

Note:
when you executed a command, the csproj file of the project will be modified to add the new created files, visual studio maybe will show a message that need to reload the project, after the project reload, you will see the new generated files.

Dependencies:
*Mono.TextTemplating for execute the t4 templates (the views,controllers and models are generated by t4 templates), with this the app also will work with mono in linux

TODO:
*The scaffold generator now only generate the index logic, i need will add this feature soon
*The commands where the model generation it's involved, i need to add a migration class, i will use fluent migration for this
*I need to add jquery, css and all additional assets to make a complete web app
*Create the database bindings using Simple.Data to complain with de Super Duper Happy Path
